1. **Discovery** Understanding what problem(s) you are trying to solve and clarifying scope.
  * *Experience:* low
  * *Strengths:* I like to "tinker" with a problem to try to figure out how to solve it
  * *Weaknesses:* Sometimes I look at too big a picture, and can miss small details
2. **Strategy** Creating and executing a plan that gathers the needed information to begin crafting a solution.
  * Experience: low
  * *Strengths:* In teaching, we use backwards design (Understanding by Design) to plan lessons. I feel this process mirrors that, especially in this case. Once I know what the problem is, I can make a roadmap of how I'll need to get to the end result.
  * *Weaknesses:* Planning is one thing, but making sure everything is executed with fidelity to the plan is another! I always need to refer to/follow my roadmap/plan.
3. **Information Architecture** Auditing the resources available to you and creating the additional resources required to build a testable solution.
  * Experience: low
  * *Strengths:* I'm adept at using multiple sources of information to enhance my knowledge
  * *Weaknesses:* I don't even know what many of the resources I'll need are at this point!
4. **Visual Design** Crafting the visual direction for the project that aligns with the solution.
  * Experience: low
  * *Strengths:* I've studies art and art history and have a keen appreciation for aesthetics
  * *Weaknesses:* 
5. **Development** Building functional code to allow for further interactive testing.
  * Experience: low
  * *Strengths:* 
  * *Weaknesses:*
6. **Launch** Deploying the project to the public, presenting your work, and beginning the process over again.
  * Experience: low
  * *Strengths:* 
  * *Weaknesses:*
