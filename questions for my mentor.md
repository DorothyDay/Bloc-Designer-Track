- Github - I'm brand new and it's a little confusing for me now.What should I focus on?
- Submissions - is it an assignment, or checkpoint work? 
- Group sessions - mostly 9-5. I can't make those!
  - how to I track which ones I have attended?
    - DDC on 11/12 at 9pm
- How do I keep track of completed checkpoints? How do I mark it complete?
  - [x] I really like checklists :)

11/14: progess so far (30 min) oal setting next time
- 1st 3 modules in 7-8weeks
- quizzes should take 10-15 min
- UX fundamentals takes the longest - interviews, wait for submissions, have to work with other people.
- 1st week goal: get to checkpoint 8
- use Slack as a resource
- watch recorded group sessions
- checkpoint 4 - 2-3 bullet points each on SWOT analysis competitive analysis less is more
  - around 4 hours per checkpoint
