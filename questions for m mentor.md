- Github - I'm brand new and it's a little confusing for me now.What should I focus on?
- Submissions - is it an assignment, or checkpoint work? 
- Group sessions - mostly 9-5. I can't make those!
  - how to I track which ones I have attended?
    - DDC on 11/12 at 9pm
- How do I keep track of completed checkpoints? How do I mark it complete?
  - [x] I really like checklists :)
